    <h1 id="ThisIsMyBlog">Things I care about</h1>
    <p>Posted on Mon 25 January 2016 in <a href="./category/writing.html">Writing</a></p>

    <p>tl;dr: My blog is a jumble of things I care about and obsess over. A few you'll encounter are: innovative data science projects, improving education and making it easier for people to learn, and making our minds better by learning techniques from Stoicism and occasionally Buddhism (there is a surprising amount of similarity between the two schools of thought).</p>
<h2>Here are some things that I spend a lot of time thinking about</h2>
<h3>Data Science for improving the way people live</h3>
<p><center><figure>

<figcaption> I'm pretty sure this is what Data Science is...</figcaption>
</center></p>
<p>Most of this blog will be about data science. I love doing data science projects in Python, but I don't like the idea that I'm not really documenting what I work on or how far I get. I'll remedy that with this blog. Expect Python, expect Juptyer notebooks, expect pretty figures and plots of things that you probably don't care about.</p>
<p>I'm also going to copy something that <a href="http://danielfrg.com/">Daniel Rodriguez</a> has been doing on his blog. Daniel calls it ReproduceIt, where he takes some data science project he found online (often from <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/">FiveThirtyEight</a>) and <i>reproduces it</i> using Python tools that he is familiar with using. My plan is to find data science projects of my own to reproduce, but also to maybe reproduce some of the ones Daniel has already done: Re-ReproduceIt, if you like.</p>
<h3>Education, learning how to be better at learning</h3>
<p>Modern cognitive science studies into how people learn and retain information blow my mind. I recently went through the video lectures for <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn">Learning How to Learn on Coursera</a> by the lovely and brilliant Barbara Oakley (Terrence Sejnowski was there too). I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to be better at learning new things. It's especially useful if you're in a fast-changing field like Data Science, and you are force-learning new things every day.</p>

</figure></center></p>
<p>I'm also passionate about better learning methods and how they apply to teaching. I wish I had taken Barbara Oakley's course before I entered High School. Instead I made my way through a physics undergrad program and through most of grad school without ever having learned proper study habits. While I was going through these educational institutions, it was also clear that my professors knew nothing about how the human brain best learns. We were force-fed content in lectures without having first developing proper mental models of the subject; which would have added important context to what we were learning and why. We were tested in a high-cost, low-feedback setting, with exams that would significantly impact our grades if we did things wrong, but with little opportunity before-hand to learn about mistakes we might make. It was very much an environment where we had a <i>sage on the stage</i> and not a <i>guide on the side</i>. So I think about learning methods a lot, and will probably write about them a lot as I discover new things that work for me.</p>
<h3>How to live well; How to think better.</h3>
<p>The further I get into this crazy thing that people call <i>adulthood</i> the more I learn that <i>nobody knows what they are doing and nobody knows what they should be doing</i>. I know, that's a bold claim, and I'll probably have to support it in a later blog post. But it is this (unsubstatiated) discovery that caused me to start obsessing over ancient Roman Stoicism. Stoicism is the best school of thought I've found so far for figuring out what you should be doing with your life, and how to make progress as a person from day to day. It's about building for yourself the best mental operating system for living in a chaotic world--and we sure as hell live in a chaotic world (probably also needs to be supported in a later blog post).
Along these sames lines, I've found similar and complementary ideas in Buddhism and in trying Buddhist-style meditation through the <a href="https://www.headspace.com/signup?origintoken=google-b&amp;gclid=CJPNi-yexsoCFUVcfgodfdAHlA">Headspace app</a>.</p>

<p>So, that's my blog. I better go find some data science to do. Cheers.</p>
